Ticket: User Management
Problem:

User Story

"As a user, I should be able to register for an account, log in, and logout."

Task

For this Ticket, you'll be required to implement all the methods in db.py that are called by the API endpoints in user.py. Specifically, you'll implement:

get_user
add_user
login_user
logout_user
get_user_session
delete_user
For this ticket, you will need to use the find_one(), update_one() and delete_one() methods. You can find examples in the following notebooks:

notebooks/deletes.ipynb
notebooks/your_first_write.ipynb
MFlix Functionality

Once this ticket is completed, users will be able to register for a new account, log in, logout, and delete their account.

Registering should create an account and log the user in, ensuring an entry is made in the sessions collection. There is a unique index on the user_id field in sessions, so we can efficiently query on this field.
