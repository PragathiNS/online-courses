#### Azure Storage
It is a general purpose storage service for storing data in Azure. It is widely used by applications and can provide
distributed storage services for Big Data technologies.

**Exercise 1: Working with Azure Storage**
  1. **Provision an Azure Storage Account and a Blob Container**
       Use an Azure storage account to store data files. The files will be stored as binary large objects (BLOBs)
       in a blob store container that is hosted in your storage account
  2. **Use the Azure Portal to Upload a File to Azure Storage**
  3. **Use Azure Storage Explorer to Upload files to Azure Storage**
  
#### Azure Data Lake Store
It is a storage service in Azure that is optimized for big data workloads. It supports
unlimited numbers of files of unlimited size and can be used to organize and secure files in folder
hierarchies.
